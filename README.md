# Gomoku
Implements a simple AI engine for Gomoku on an 8Ã—8 board. Players take turns placing black or white stones, aiming to align five in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win. The black player always moves first. This project showcases a basic, imperfect AI for simulating Gomoku gameplay.
